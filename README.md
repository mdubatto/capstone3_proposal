# Capstone 3 Proposal

### Option 1:
[Brazilian E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv)
* I'd want to forecast the monthly order volumes for each item using ARIMA and LSTM models.
* I was thinking I can create additional features based on the product ratings (if the number of reviews/month of an item is increasing and the average rating is also high it might impact the # of orders received).

### Option 2:
[Flight Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv)
* Predict whether a flight will be cancelled
